Orphan raster code:  F-means that no orphan channel raster(s) are involved for this cell ID;
Orphan raster code:  T-means that orphan channel raster(s) make up this cell.  The entire subarea for this new cell ID
                       is made up of reassigned channel raster(s) to a rightside cell whose subarea did not previously
                       have any rasters that were assigned to any related source; right-; or leftside cells.
